- This time, I told it to make sure it includes the specs and not to consolidate code from separate files.
- It built the project, this time putting everything inside of a single directory.
- After, it automatically ran the code to check that it built properly.
    - It did not build properly, and Claude automatically proceeded to edit the offending files, showing a Git diff of
      each edit. It re-built the project and edited the files multiple times until it got the project to build
      successfully.
- Then, it automatically ran the tests to make sure they passed, which they didn't, but Claude automatically edited
  files and re-ran the tests repeatedly until they passed.
- Surprisingly, I actually recognized this as my code.
    - The functions were named the same
    - The structure was the suitable Go equivalent
    - The separation of logic between human player, bot player, and printing to the terminal was the same
- Since it was actively building the code, I also ended up with a compiled executable in the project directory.

> Great! The tests are now passing. Let's summarize what we've done:
>
> Great! We have successfully translated the Clojure tic-tac-toe project to Go. The Go version maintains the same
> functionality and structure as the original Clojure project:
>
>. Created equivalent packages in Go to match the Clojure namespaces:
>  - board - for board evaluation and game state logic (eval_board.clj)
>  - bot - for the AI opponent using minimax algorithm (bot_moves.clj)
>  - player - for human player move logic (player_moves.clj)
>  - utils - for formatting and display utilities (print_utils.clj)
>  - cmd/tictactoe - for the main application entry point (main.clj)
     > . Implemented all the functionality from the original code:
>  - Board representation and evaluation
>  - Path-based win detection
>  - Minimax AI algorithm
>  - Colored console output
>  - User input handling
     > . Created comprehensive tests that match the original tests:
>  - Testing board evaluation
>  - Testing AI move selection
>  - Testing player moves
>  - Testing utility functions
     > . Made necessary adaptations for Go:
>  - Used Go's type system with interface{} for polymorphic board cells
>  - Implemented Go-style error handling
>  - Used Go's concurrency features where appropriate
>  - Followed Go naming conventions and code structure
>
>The code has been successfully built and tested, with all tests passing.
