- After setting up Claude Code with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, I `cd` into the project directory
and started a session with `claude`.
- After authenticating in the browser, I asked it to translate the project to Go.
- The AI showed me the `main.go` file it wanted to create and asked if it could write the file to the file system.
- After giving it permission to create files and directories without asking, it proceeded to create the directory
structure we see here. This is simplified from the original directory structure. The logic for the computer player,
human player, and printing to the terminal is all in one file (`player.go`), with some printing logic also being in
`board.go`.
- It also created a README.md file with instructions on how to run the Go version.

- It did not translate and create any of the test files. 
- After asking it to translate the test files, it created test files and placed them in their appropriate locations. 
- Even though all the printing logic was located inside `player.go`, it
still created a separate `print_test.go` file. It also updated the README with instructions on how to run the tests.

> Can you translate this repo to Go?
>
> ⏺ To translate this Clojure tic-tac-toe repo to Go, I'll need to analyze the codebase first to understand its
> structure and functionality.
>
> ⏺ I'll now create a Go implementation of this tic-tac-toe game. Let me start by creating the basic structure and
> files.
>
> ⏺ Now let's create the board package with evaluation functions:
>
> ⏺ Now let's create the player package with player and bot move logic:
>
> ⏺ Let's create a go.mod file to set up the Go module:
>
> ⏺ Finally, let's create a README.md file with instructions on how to run the Go version:
>
> ⏺ The Clojure tic-tac-toe implementation has been successfully translated to Go. The new implementation:
>
> 1. Uses Go's package structure with board and player packages
> 2. Maintains the same game logic and minimax AI algorithm
> 3. Preserves the console UI with similar colored display
> 4. Uses Go's static typing instead of Clojure's dynamic typing
>
> To run the game: go run main.go


> The files that you created are great! They maintain the functionality and appearance of the original. However, I
> noticed that you didn't translate the tests. Can you also translate the test files please?
>
> ⏺ I'll translate the test files to Go. Let's first examine the original Clojure test files to understand their
> functionality.
> 
> ⏺ Now I'll create the corresponding Go test files. Let's start by setting up the test directories:
> 
> ⏺ Now, let's create the board tests:
> 
> ⏺ Now, let's create the player tests:
> 
> ⏺ Now, let's create a utility test file for print functions:
> 
> ⏺ Let's create a main test file to run all tests:
> 
> ⏺ Finally, let's update the README_GO.md file to include information about running the tests:
> 
> I've translated the Clojure tests to Go test files following Go's standard testing package conventions:
> 
> 1. Created board/board_test.go with:
>    - Tests for evaluating the board state
>    - Tests for getting winning paths
>    - Tests for scoring the game
> 2. Created player/player_test.go with:
>    - Tests for the AI to find winning moves
>    - Tests for the AI to block opponent's winning moves
>    - Tests for strategic moves
>    - Tests for the minimax algorithm components
> 3. Created board/print_test.go for testing board printing functionality
> 4. Added a main_test.go file as a placeholder for main package tests
> 5. Updated the README_GO.md with instructions for running tests
> 
> You can run the tests with go test ./... to test all packages or target specific packages with go test ./board or go test ./player.
