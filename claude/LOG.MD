After setting up Claude Code with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, I `cd` into the project directory and starting a session with `claude`. 
After authenticating in the browser, I asked it to translate the project to Go. 
The AI showed me the `main.go` file it wanted to create and asked if it could write the file to the file system. 
After giving it permission to create files and directories without asking, it proceeded to create the directory 
structure we see here.

> # Tic-Tac-Toe in Go
> This is a Go implementation of a command-line tic-tac-toe game with an unbeatable AI opponent.
> ## Features
> - Command-line interface
> - Play against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm
> - Human plays as X, computer plays as O

> ⏺ The Clojure tic-tac-toe implementation has been successfully translated to Go. The new implementation:
> 
> 1. Uses Go's package structure with board and player packages
> 2. Maintains the same game logic and minimax AI algorithm
> 3. Preserves the console UI with similar colored display
> 4. Uses Go's static typing instead of Clojure's dynamic typing
> 
> To run the game: go run main.go
